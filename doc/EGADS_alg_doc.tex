\chapter{Introduction}

This document contains descriptions of algorithms contained in the \egads toolbox. Within each algorithm description is the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Algorithm Name} -- name of algorithm as implemented in \egads.
\item \textbf{Category} -- general category of algorithm. Algorithm can be found in this subdirectory in \egads.
\item \textbf{Summary} -- short description of what the algorithm does.
\item \textbf{Inputs} -- expected inputs to algorithm. This field includes expected units, and data type of input.
\item \textbf{Outputs} -- outputs produced by algorithm.
\item \textbf{Formula} -- description of formulas or methods behind the algorithm.
\item \textbf{Source} -- person, institution or entity who provided the algorithm.
\item \textbf{References} -- any references to literature, journals or documents with more information on the current algorithm
\end{itemize}

To aid in algorithm usage, there is a general naming scheme for \egads algorithms. Generally, algorithm names are composed as follows: |{general calculation}_{specific calculation}_{source}|. So, for example, an algorithm provided by CNRM to calculate the density of dry air would be named |density_dry_air_cnrm|.
