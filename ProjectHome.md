# Project Overview #

EGADS (EUFAR General Airborne Data-processing Software) is a Python-based
toolbox for processing airborne atmospheric data. EGADS provides a framework
for researchers to apply expert-contributed algorithms to data files, and acts
as a platform for data intercomparison. Algorithms in EGADS will be
contributed by members of the EUFAR Expert Working Group if they are found to be mature and
well-established in the scientific community.

EGADS is under development by [EUFAR](http://www.eufar.net/) (European Facility for Airborne Research), an Integrating Activity funded by the European Commission. Specifically, the networking activity N6SP within EUFAR is responsible for development of toolbox, in addition to developing standards for use within the EUFAR community. A compilation of these standards and other N6SP products is available on the [N6SP Wiki](http://bo.eufar.net/wiki/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/N6SP/N6SP)

## More Information ##
An overview of how the toolbox is installed and used can be found at the EGADS Documentation [HTTP](http://packages.python.org/egads/)/[PDF](http://eufar-egads.googlecode.com/files/EGADS_doc_0.5.8.pdf). Information on the specific algorithms can be found in the [Algorithm Documentation](http://eufar-egads.googlecode.com/files/EGADS_alg_doc_0.5.8.pdf).
