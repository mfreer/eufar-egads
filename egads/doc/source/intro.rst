Introduction

The EGADS (EUFAR General Airborne Data-processing Software) package is a suite of processing software designed to analyze a wide range of airborne atmospheric science data. EGADS' purpose is to provide a benchmark for airborne data-processing through its community-provided algorithms, and to act as a reference by providing guidance to researchers with an open-source design and well-documented processing routines.

Python is used in development of EGADS due to its straightforward syntax and portability between various systems. Users interact with data processing algorithms using the Python command-line or by creating Python scripts for more complex tasks. EGADS' core is built upon data type that encapsulates data and metadata into one object. This simplifies the housekeeping of data and metadata and allows it to be easily passed between algorithms and data files. Algorithms in EGADS also contain metadata elements that allow data and their sources to be tracked through processing chains.
