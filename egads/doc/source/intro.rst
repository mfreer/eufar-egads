Introduction

The EGADS (EUFAR General Airborne Data-processing Software) package is a suite of processing software designed to analyze a wide range of airborne atmospheric science data. EGADS purpose is to provide a benchmark for airborne data-processing with its community-provided algorithms, and to act as a reference and to provide guidance to researchers with its open-source design and well-documented processing routines.

Python was chosen for development of EGADS for its straightforward syntax and flexiblity between multiple systems. Thus, users interact with data processing algorithms using the Python command-line or via Python scripts. Central to EGADS is a data type that encapsulates data and metadata into one object. This simplifies the housekeeping of data and metadata and allows it to be easily passed between algorithms and data files.
