The EGADS (EUFAR General Airborne Data-processing Software) package is a Python-based, open-source collection of mature, community-contributed algorithms for processing all aspects of airborne atmospheric science data. EGADS provides standard libraries to interface with common data formats such as NetCDF and NASA Ames. EGADS was created to provide a centralized library of algorithms for reference to operators, researchers and users of airborne data. 

The current EGADS implementation allows users to interact with data processing algorithms using the Python command-line or via Python scripts. Python was chosen due to its straightforward syntax and flexibility between multiple systems. Central to EGADS is a data type that encapsulates data and metadata into one object. This simplifies the housekeeping of such data, and allows it to be easily passed between algorithms and data files.

*Structure*
The EGADS core framework contains a data class called EgadsData that permits data and metadata to be easily passed between functions in a consistent manner. EGADS algorithms accept the EgadsData as inputs, and return populated instances of the EGADS data class.
